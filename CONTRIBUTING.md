Welcome! There are many ways to contribute to this project and not all of them require programming knowledge.

## Participate in the community
Join the [Apeira Discord server](http://discord.apeira.net) to chat with contributors and users alike.

## Write and update documentation
Torch is complex software with a lot of possible configurations. Share your expertise by contributing to the [Wiki](https://github.com/apeira/Torch/wiki)
or answering questions in [Discussions](https://github.com/apeira/Torch/discussions)!

## Report bugs and suggest new features
No software is perfect, but high quality bug reports can get problems fixed quickly. You can report bugs using
the [Bug Report](https://github.com/apeira/Torch/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md) issue template.

If you have an idea for a feature that would make Torch better, you can suggest it by creating a [Feature Request](https://github.com/apeira/Torch/issues/new?assignees=&labels=suggestion&template=feature_request.md).

## Contribute code
There is always something to add or improve in Torch. Check out the open [issues](https://github.com/apeira/Torch/issues) or come up with
your own ideas!

### Code Contribution Guidelines
* Pull requests should focus on one specific feature or area. If you submit a pull request that makes a dozen 
  changes across the entire codebase without a good reason it is very unlikely that it will be considered.
* Strictly follow the style rules defined in `.editorconfig` and the `Apeira.StyleCop` analyzer package. Because
  this project is open source it's important to keep the code as consistent and maintainable as possible.
* Don't make major changes to existing behavior without discussing it in an issue or discussion first. You don't
  want to go overboard on something that won't end up getting merged.
* If you have any questions, feel free to start a thread in [Discussions](https://github.com/apeira/Torch/discussions).

## Monetary support
I (Jimmacle) don't do this for profit, but Torch has expenses like domain registration, server space, and other software/services that cost money. Consider
